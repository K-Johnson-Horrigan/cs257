Command Line Interface

python3 books.py 
	This program reads a passed search string with a specified category and prints all the books in books.csv that satisfy the specifications. For example, asking for 
		-a "tolstoy"
	will print all works in books.csv who have "tolstoy" (case-insensitive) in their author column. Read on to learn how each specific command works!

	--help / help / -h
		Prints the usage.txt page to the console, explaining to the user the allowable commands and providing examples as to their construction.

	--author / -a
		Prints a list of books whose authors contain "S" (case-insensitive, a-z characters). You can expand your search and look for books by different authors in one command by, within the quotation marks containing the search string, adding a comma, space, and the name of the other author. Note that when searching for multiple authors you will be returned all works that contain at least one of the listed authors. Author name will be included in the output, to clarify who wrote the work, to minimize confusion (if in a situation such as a search string matching to several authors).
		examples: 
			--author "dickenson"
			-a "Austen"
			--author "AUsteN, morrison, tolstoy"
			-a "h, i"
		
	--year / -y
		Prints a list of books published between years A and B (inclusive). Give the range of years in the form: "A-B". It is possible to search for multiple ranges by providing two pairs of years within quotation marks and seperated by a comma and space. 
		examples: 
			--year "1980-1991"
			-y "2000-2020"
			--year "1900-1905, 2000-2005"
		
	--title / -t
		Prints a list of books whose titles contain String "S" (case-insensitive). It is not possible to search for multiple titles.
		examples: 
			--title "h"
			-t "Crime and PUNishment"

	Using multiple tags
		You can combine author/year/title tags to recieve a list of works that contain any one of the search strings mentioned (in their appropriate category). To do this, enter a command, followed by a space and its search string, then a space and the next command-searh string pair, as demonstrated in the examples below. Please note that this combination of multiple tags only works for different, and so the maximum number of tags would be three. If you wish to search for multiple search strings within a given category, please see the appropriate tag description above for desctiption of whether the functionality is supported and how to make use of it.
		examples:
			-a "author" -y "0-0" --title "title"
			--title "h" --author "a" 
			-a "h" -t "Crime and Punishment"
	
	To access this usage.txt page again, just enter the -h/--help command or give no command!
